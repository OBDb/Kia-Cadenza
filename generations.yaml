    description: "The original Kia Cadenza (known as the K7 in South Korea) was introduced as Kia's full-size sedan, positioned above the Optima and below the flagship K900. Featuring conservative yet elegant styling developed under the direction of design chief Peter Schreyer, it represented Kia's upmarket aspirations. Built on a platform shared with the Hyundai Azera, it featured a front-wheel drive layout with a transverse-mounted engine. Powered primarily by a 3.3L V6 engine producing 293 HP in the North American market, paired with a six-speed automatic transmission. The interior offered near-luxury appointments including available leather seating, wood trim, dual-zone climate control, and a premium audio system. Technology features included available navigation, backup camera, and various driver assistance systems—advanced for a mainstream brand at the time. This generation established the Cadenza as Kia's premium sedan offering in most markets, demonstrating the brand's evolution from a budget-oriented manufacturer to one capable of producing refined, well-equipped vehicles competitive with established near-luxury models."

    description: "The second-generation Cadenza featured more sophisticated styling with a more distinctive front end featuring Kia's 'tiger nose' grille interpretation and Z-shaped LED lighting signatures. Built on an updated platform with increased use of high-strength steel and structural adhesives, it offered improved rigidity, safety, and refinement. Powered by a revised 3.3L V6 engine producing 290 HP, paired with a new eight-speed automatic transmission—Kia's first in-house developed eight-speed. The interior represented a significant advancement with higher quality materials, more sophisticated design, and enhanced technology including an available 12-speaker Harman Kardon audio system, 8-inch touchscreen interface, and head-up display. Safety technology expanded to include adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking, and blind-spot detection. Available in multiple trim levels including the luxury-oriented Limited with quilted Nappa leather seating and other premium features. This generation elevated the Cadenza's positioning as a sophisticated, technology-rich alternative to both mainstream and premium full-size sedans, winning numerous awards for its combination of refinement, features, and value. Despite critical acclaim, declining sedan sales in many markets led to modest commercial success, and the model was discontinued in the North American market after the 2020 model year, though it continues as the K7 in some international markets."
